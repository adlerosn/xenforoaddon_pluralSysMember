### Scenario

In a community with a considerable prevalence of [plural systems](https://www.reddit.com/r/plural/wiki/glossary), they wanted a quote-like appearance that identifies a "system member" with name and color.

### Solution

An add-on that easily allows those people to express themselves more freely and easily.
